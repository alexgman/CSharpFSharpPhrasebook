# C#/F# Cheatsheet

This is a list of code samples showing the translation from C# to F# code.

The idea is that if you can easily do the same stuff you already know from C#,
that gives you some solid ground to stand on for learning the features that
_don't_ exist in C#.

The samples are currently split into two sections:

* [Code](CheatsheetCode.md) shows how to translate the code you write inside
  methods: variable assignments, loops, conditionals, etc.

* [Code](CheatsheetTypes.md) shows how to translate the code you write to define
  classes, interfaces, enums, generics, etc.
